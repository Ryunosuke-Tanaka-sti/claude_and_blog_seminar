## Key Documentation Patterns

### File Naming Convention
- Japanese documentation uses descriptive titles with spaces and Japanese characters
- Image files follow the pattern: `[topic].png` or `[topic]-[variant].png`
- Markdown files may include unique identifiers at the end (likely from Notion exports)

### Content Focus Areas
1. **AI-Assisted Writing Workflows** - Documentation covers complete writing processes from ideation to publication
2. **Prompt Engineering** - Specific templates and techniques for effective Claude interaction
3. **Tool Integration** - Guides for combining Claude with other tools (Notion, Mermaid, etc.)
4. **Quality Control** - Multi-stage review processes using AI
5. **Training Materials** - Structured seminar content for teaching these techniques

### Seminar Materials Structure
The `seminar/` directory contains a complete 45-minute workshop structure:
- `seminar_structure.md` - Overall seminar timeline and agenda
- `introduction_script.md` - Speaker notes for beginner-friendly introduction
- `demo_scenarios.md` - Live demonstration scenarios
- `prompt_templates.md` - Reusable prompt templates for participants
- `quick_start_guide.md` - Immediate action items for participants
- `practice_checklist.md` - Follow-up practice exercises

## Working with This Repository

### Content Creation Guidelines
- Documentation should focus on practical, actionable techniques
- Include specific prompt templates that users can copy and use
- Provide before/after examples showing efficiency gains
- Use Japanese language for primary content targeting Japanese technical bloggers

### Image Handling
- Screenshots and diagrams are stored alongside related markdown files
- Mermaid diagrams are frequently used and should be compatible with Mermaid Live Editor
- Images include both instructional screenshots and generated diagram examples

### Quality Standards
- All techniques should be tested and validated with actual time savings
- Content should be accessible to AI beginners while providing value to intermediate users
- Prompt templates must work with free-tier Claude access when possible
